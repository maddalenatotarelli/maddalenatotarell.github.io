            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of Erik Plug and Giuseppe Sorrenti.

              I am an applied microeconomist with a focus on labor, education, and crime economics.

            In my Job Market Paper I study how prison rehabilitation programs can support the successful reintegration of former prisoners into society. 

 
            During my PhD, I visited the Center for the Economics of Human Development, hosted by Professor James J. Heckman, and the Norwegian School of Economics, hosted by Professor Katrine V. LÃ¸ken.

 


              I am on the academic job market this fall 2024/2025.
